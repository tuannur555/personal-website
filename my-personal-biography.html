	<p><strong> Hi everyone! My name is Tuan Nur Syahirah bt Tuan Abdul Aziz and I turn 20 years old in this year. I was born in Hospital Kota Bharu, Kelantan on 6 December 2000. I have a total of 7 siblings including me and our family currently live in Kota Bharu Kelantan. My dad is a video editor while my mom is a teacher. My hobby is listening to music and watching korean drama. I am a final year university student at UiTM Machang studying in the course of Information Management. I am here to tell you about key features I have in myself. </strong></p>


	<p><strong>	Firstly, I am an hardworking person. This is because I always diligent in doing my work. For example, I like to make sure that my assignments are neatly organized and I have my own standards to get a good results. Besides that, if I need to do work that I do not know how, I will learn them until I understand them clearly. </strong></p>

	<p><strong> Next, I am also a good leader. For example, I am able to lead my group members in doing the group assignments. I will make sure that they complete their part of assignments as well as help them if there are any problems. </strong></p>

	<p><strong> Lastly, I am also an independent person. I didn't often ask for people help if I am capable to do something except when I'm in emergency. I also didn't get mad easily and deal with things carefully. </strong></p>
